# Malaria Data Science: Analysis and Modeling

## What This Project Is About

This project uses data science to study malaria. We're trying to understand who gets malaria and what makes them more likely to get it.  We're looking at things like where people live, how easy it is to get healthcare, and if using mosquito nets helps.  We also built computer models to predict who is at risk.

## What We Wanted to Find Out

*   **How Common is Malaria?** We looked at how many people have malaria in different areas and groups.
*   **What Causes Malaria?** We tried to find out what things make people more likely to get malaria.
*   **Do Mosquito Nets and Other Things Help?**  We wanted to see if things like mosquito nets and spraying for mosquitoes really work to stop malaria.

## What's in This Project

Here are the important files

*   **`jeandedieu_ngirinshuti_MDS2.Rmd`:**  This is the main file. It's like a recipe that shows all the steps we took to analyze the data, make the graphs, and build the models.
*   **`jeandedieu_ngirinshuti_MDS2.html`:** This is the finished report. It's easy to read and has all the graphs and results from our analysis.

## What We Learned

Here are some of the main things we found

*   **Where You Live Matters:**  Malaria is more common in some areas than others.  It's also more common when people don't have good access to doctors and hospitals.
*   **Some People are More at Risk:** Young children (under 5) and pregnant women are more likely to get malaria.
*   **Mosquito Nets Help!**  Using mosquito nets and spraying inside houses really does help to stop malaria.
 

## How to Run This Project Yourself

If you want to run the code and see the results yourself, here's what to do

1.  **Make sure you have R and RStudio:** You'll need these programs installed on your computer.

2.  **Install some extra tools (packages):** Open RStudio and type in the following lines, then press Enter after each one:

    ```r
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "caret", "randomForest"))
    ```

3.  **Open the main file and run it:** Open the `jeandedieu_ngirinshuti_MDS2.Rmd` file in RStudio.  Then, click the button that says "Knit". This will create the report (`jeandedieu_ngirinshuti_MDS2.html`).
